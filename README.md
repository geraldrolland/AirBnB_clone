AirBnB Clone (Console) Overview

This repository houses the fundamental components of the AirBnB project, including the base model for every object and corresponding classes, along with the essential storage file. Serving as a command-line console, it manages the commands required for the actual AirBnB website, offering a glimpse into the world of AirBnB and web applications.

Functionality and Objectives

Parent Class (BaseModel):
Responsible for initializing, serializing, and deserializing future instances.
Establishes a streamlined flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> File.

Creation of AirBnB Classes:
Develops classes for all entities used in AirBnB (User, State, City, Place, etc.), each inheriting from the BaseModel.

Abstracted Storage Engine:
Introduces the initial storage engine for the project, specifically a File storage system

Unit Testing:
Implements comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of all classes and the storage engine.

Key Learnings

Command Interpreter in Python:
Demonstrates how to create a command interpreter using the cmd module.

Python Package Creation:
Provides insights into creating a Python package for better organization.

Unit Testing in a Large Project:
Explains the concept of unit testing and its implementation in a larger project context.

JSON File Handling:
Offers guidance on reading and writing JSON files.

Serialization and Deserialization:
Explains the process of deserializing and serializing a Class instance.
